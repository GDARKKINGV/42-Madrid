# 42-Madrid

42 is the first computer programming school that is entirely free and available to students with or without degrees who are 18-years or older. Its teaching methods are based on peer learning: no teachers, no lectures, fully hands on. 42 allows students to free their creativity through project learning.


This repository is created to track my progress as a student of 42, document the projects being carried out, and assist future students who wish to use this repository.

## ❗Try not to simply copy the code, but to understand it and learn how to do it yourself.❗
