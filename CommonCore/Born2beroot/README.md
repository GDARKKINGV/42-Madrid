# Welcome to the Virtualization project! 🙌

# Since I don't have much experience with VMs to do this project, I followed a very good guide. The guide I used and recommend is this one 👉[Born2berootGuide](https://github.com/gemartin99/Born2beroot-Tutorial)

## This project aims to introduce you to the fascinating world of virtualization. You will create your first virtual machine using VirtualBox or UTM (if VirtualBox is not available) following specific instructions. By the end of the project, you will be capable of configuring your own operating system using strict rules.

## Project Overview: 📃
In this project, you will set up your first virtual machine using VirtualBox or UTM. Virtualization technology allows you to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical machine, providing flexibility, scalability, and isolation for various computing tasks.

## Key Concepts: 🗝️
- Understanding virtualization and its benefits.
- Setting up virtual machines using VirtualBox or UTM.
- Configuring operating systems within virtual environments.
- Following strict guidelines and instructions for system configuration.

## Project Objectives: 💎
- Create a virtual machine using VirtualBox or UTM according to provided instructions.
- Install and configure an operating system on the virtual machine.
- Follow specific guidelines and rules for system configuration.
- Test the virtual machine to ensure proper functionality and adherence to requirements.

## Project Guidelines: 📚
- Carefully read and follow the provided instructions for setting up the virtual machine.
- Choose appropriate settings and configurations as specified in the guidelines.
- Document the steps taken during the setup process for future reference.
- Test the virtual machine thoroughly to verify its functionality and compliance with requirements.

## Conclusion:
Completing the Virtualization project will give you valuable experience in setting up and configuring virtual machines, which is a crucial skill in today's computing environment. Follow the instructions diligently, pay attention to details, and experiment with different configurations to gain a deeper understanding of virtualization technology. Enjoy exploring the wonderful world of virtualization!
