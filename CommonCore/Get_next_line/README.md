# Welcome to the get_next_line project! In this project 🙌
## you will implement a function that reads a file descriptor line by line until the end of the file or an error occurs. This exercise provides an excellent opportunity to enhance your file I/O and string manipulation skills in C.

## Project Overview: 📃
The main objective of this project is to implement the get_next_line function, which reads content from a file descriptor line by line. By repeatedly calling get_next_line in a loop, you can read the file's content efficiently, ensuring proper handling of end-of-file conditions and errors.

## Key Concepts: 🗝️
- Understanding file I/O operations in C.
- Implementing efficient string manipulation techniques.
- Handling edge cases and errors gracefully.
- Utilizing helper functions for code modularity and reusability.

## Project Tips: 💎
- Familiarize yourself with file descriptors and their usage in C.
- Develop a clear understanding of how to read data line by line.
- Test your function thoroughly with various input files, including standard input (stdin).
- Ensure your implementation adheres to the specified behavior and edge cases.

## Project Objectives: 🎯
- Implement the get_next_line function to read content from a file descriptor line by line.
- Handle end-of-file conditions and errors gracefully, returning NULL when appropriate.
- Ensure proper behavior when reading from both files and standard input (stdin).
- Terminate lines with the newline character ('\n'), unless the end of the file is reached and it doesn't end with a newline.

## Project Resources: 📚
- Refer to C programming guides and tutorials for file I/O operations.
- Explore string manipulation techniques and functions available in the C standard library.
- Collaborate with peers and seek guidance from mentors to address challenges effectively.

## Conclusion:
Completing the get_next_line project is an excellent opportunity to strengthen your skills in file I/O, string manipulation, and error handling in C. Approach the project systematically, test your implementation rigorously, and ensure adherence to project requirements and specifications. Best of luck! 😁
